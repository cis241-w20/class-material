# Minilab 06

1. Clone `git@github.com:cis241-w20/minilab06.git`
2. Create a new branch (with your github username as the
   branch name to ensure no one tries to use the same name).
3. Create, add, commit, and push a file with 6
   lines of text to your branch
4. Turn to the person next to you, each of you should:
    * Edit lines 2 and 5 of the file you just made on your branch
      but don't add/commit/push yet
    * Run `git fetch`
    * Checkout the branch of the person next to you
    * Edit lines 1 through 3 of the file they made in their branch
    * Add, commit, and push the changes
    * Checkout your own branch again
    * Run `git pull` (once your partner is done with the editing
      your branch
5. You should each get a merge conflict when you try to pull
6. Resolve the merge conflict using the mergetool of your choice
   or by manually editing the files with no mergetool
7. Don't forget to add, commit, push after resolving the merges
